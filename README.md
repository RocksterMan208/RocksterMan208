# Hi there 👋

<br> My name is **Ashton** and I am a hobby programmer. I dont expect much from my own code. <br>

- Python
- Dabbled in AutoHotkey coding for automation.

### Why do I code?

Coding is a hobby to me and it allows me to put my thoughts into something tangible that I can interact with. It's just gratifying knowing what I code comes out usable by me and other people.
##

### Here is my hackatime stats and you can see the time I have spent coding in each language.
