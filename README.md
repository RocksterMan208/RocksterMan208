# Hi there 👋

<br> My name is **Ashton** and I am a fairly new programmer. <br>
(He/Him)

##

### The languages I am learning:
- C++ (currently making a project in C++)
- Python
- Dabbled in AutoHotkey coding for automation.
  <br><br>

### Why do I code?

I code as a hobby, I find it fun to code as it just harbours the logical creativity which I dont exactly excel at in a presentable way. My own lack of talent makes each
success feel fantastic and ups my own self-esteem knowing I improved on something which may be seen as compilcated to other non-coders.

##

### Here is my hackatime stats and you can see the time I have spent coding in each language.
